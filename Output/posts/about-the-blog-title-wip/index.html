We, <a href="https://www.inuk.blog/author/hillytech">Wesley</a> and <a href="https://www.inuk.blog/author/bastian">I</a>, want full transparency between you, the reader, and us, so here's a small post on some decisions from the beginning.</p><h2>Why did we choose Ghost as our CMS?</h2><p>Originally I wanted to make my own CMS, I once before made a simple blogging CMS in <a href="http://vapor.codes">Vapor</a>, which I later threw out the window. So I thought I could do it again in a short amount of time, but the task quickly became daunting. But I really wanted to launch the site so I could get Wesley onboard from the get-go. I started without a CMS, and I don't like the admin panel of <a href="wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, I wanted something self-hosted. I decided on <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, as I know one <a href="https://www.milanvit.net/">using it</a>, and being happy with it.</p><p>I didn't know much I'd love the CMS before installing it, my thought was to slowly replace parts, which I still might, as Ghost is much more modular than initially thought!</p><p>As an example of the modular structure; I am currently writing an <a href="https://github.com/Human-Entertainment/AppleNewsPusher">Apple News publisher for Ghost</a>, so we can easily push to Apple News, while just using a single front end. <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/api/?_ga=2.177940391.300750195.1557213044-1884705885.1554712874">Ghost's API</a> is exhaustive enough that it's possible to change the admin panel, make a custom front end, and suddenly Ghost is just an interface to a database. According to Ghost's website, big sites like <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/">Apple Newsroom</a> is using Ghost, but that's not fully apparent on their site, which show's the extensibility of Ghost, or rather how easy it is to include Ghost in your current project.</p><h3>Apple News Publisher</h3><p>The flow of the publisher tool I'm writing will begin it's cycle with a text editor with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown support</a>, and uploaded to Ghost, <a href="https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/">which also supports Markdown</a>. When the article is published, <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/api/webhooks/">a Webhook</a> will be activated on a different server. The server then asks Ghost for a <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/api/content/#posts">list of all published articles</a>, parses that and pushes to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news-publisher/">Apple News</a>.</p><p>In the future, I might make a publishing platform. This platform will send <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/api/admin/#creating-a-post">to Ghost</a> as well as Apple News, for better control, as Ghost's Webhooks only does <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp">basic get requests</a>.</p><p>I might not remove Ghost completely, but I could see myself playing with the modules for fun, while keeping the stable parts intact, until my fun becomes stable.</p><p>In the future, I'll also plan to make an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a> translation layer, and maybe even release these tools for a source of income, if interest arise.</p><h2>Monetization</h2><p>Wesley and I hope to, in the near future, be making a decent penny for this project.</p><p>Part of why we want to publish to Apple News, is to get a revenue stream. We're also discussing various other revenue streams, sponsored content, ads, affiliate links and stuff like that.</p><h2>Analytics</h2><p>For analytics we use <a href="https://referral.simpleanalytics.com/bastian-inuk-christensen">SimpleAnalytics</a>, as they have a <a href="https://simpleanalytics.io/privacy">lucrative privacy policy</a>, something <a href="https://inuk.blog/privacypartone/">we highly value</a>. I feel confident in their privacy policy, due to the service <a href="https://simpleanalytics.io/#signup">not being a free service</a>. I have decided to keep the analytics <a href="https://simpleanalytics.io/inuk.blog/">open for anyone to see</a> for the sake of full transparency.</p><p>If you've got any questions, you're welcome to contact <a href="https://twitter.com/HilliTech">Wesley</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/BastianInuk">I</a> on twitter.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/blog">blog</a></li><li><a href="/tags/inuk-entertainment">inuk entertainment</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Proudly generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/CxPyCCJ">Discord</a> | <a href="/feed.rss">RSS</a></p></footer></body></html>
